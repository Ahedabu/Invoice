# Invoice


 Here a react application for creating an invoice by fetching data from Json file or API 
 
 - First install Node.js 
 - Go through the folder of the project. 
 - Type command through terminal or Command Prompt 
  npm install 
  npm start 

- Make sure that the local is http://localhost:3000/ otherwise you should change the path of the json file in the code. 
- The application is written in App.js file. 
- The links which I used for bootstrap CSS and Jquery as sources exist in index.html in Public folder. 
- The json file of the invoice under public folder.
